# Lab 04: Getting started with HTML and CSS

The files in this folder are structured as follows:

- `FilmLibrary.png`: a representation of the desired application's layout.
- `index-not-responsive.html`: the HTML page designed to be rendered only on a desktop screen (Exercise 1).
- `index.html`: the same HTML page designed in a responsive way (Exercise 2).
- `style.css`: a CSS file used by both the previous two HTML files.
